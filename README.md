// define a variable FOR the words at random
// define a constant FOR the letters
// define a variable FOR the user’s choice
// define a variable FOR the letters picked


// Compare the user’s letter choice to the correct one
// IF the user selects the correct letter
	// THEN the letter will go in the box
// ELSE IF the user’s choice is incorrect 
	// THEN the letter will go in the wrong pile
// IF the user gets all the correct letters of the word 
	// THEN they win the game


// Select the play again button element and add an event listener. On click:
    // Reset the box to clear out the word
    // Reset the missed letters
   // Switch to a new word
